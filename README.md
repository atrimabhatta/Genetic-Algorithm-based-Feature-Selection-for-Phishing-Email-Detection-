# Genetic-Algorithm-based-Feature-Selection-for-Phishing-Email-Detection-
An experimental project using Genetic Algorithms (GA) to automatically select the most important textual and metadata-based features from phishing emails. By combining TF-IDF with email header anomaly detection, this project improves phishing/spam classification accuracy while keeping it lightweight and offline.
